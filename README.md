# ISBN-Checking-and-Validation
Solution to a challenge on Edabit, found at the following link: https://edabit.com/challenge/DpFmDxcyesPfPoFMn

The International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique identifying number given to each published book. ISBNs assigned after January 2007 are 13 digits long (ISBN-13), however books with 10-digit ISBNs are still in wide use.

This application performs the following:

1. Return "Invalid" if it is not a valid ISBN-10 or ISBN-13.
2. Return "Valid" if it is a valid ISBN-13.
3. If it is a valid ISBN-10, convert it into an ISBN-13 and return the ISBN-13 number.

To download this repo and modify the code, you can follow the instructions at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation on how to setup your virtual environment for Streamlit.
I used Anaconda Navigator, but there are a few options you may choose from.
